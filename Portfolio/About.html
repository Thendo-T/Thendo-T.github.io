									<h3 class="major">About Thendo</h3>
									<p>An aspiring programmer in the making.
									currently freelancing,finishing my studies at Damelin College and active on <a href="http:/wecodecamp.org">Wecodecamp.org</a> bootcamp
									to further solidify my foundation in coding and understanding of most topics not learned in school.</p>

									<p>There are few if close to none of the projects I am currently or have previously working on that have been published.
									Due to lack of knowledge of back-end and hosting of sites,I had to put most projects on Hitus. After learning how to host the problem now came with finding out
									that my foundations were week,hence the process of learning more from <a href="http:/wecodecamp.org">Wecodecamp.org</a></p>
									<h3 class="major">Complete Projects</h3>
									<p>This is a compilation of the projects I have worked on and have completed</p>

											<h3 class="major"><a href="http:/betteryourhealth.co.za">Better Your Health</a></h3>
											<p>This project was worked on from a template found online. It is my first ever successful project that worked as well as it did with few responsive
											issues.The more I worked on this project the more I broadened my horizon in the field of programming and got to know how little I knew about what I was doing.
											Hence,the site was a little inflexible and sometimes unresponsive to commands set for specific fields such as the immages for example. they either appeared well or 
											automatically cropped the picture even when not specified.</p>

											<h3 class="major"><a href="http:/betteryourhealth.co.za/modern">Better Your Health(Updated)</a></h3>
											<p>Due to struggles with some of the code of the first <a href="http:/betteryourhealth.co.za"> Better your health</a> site a colleague and I decided to change the whole layout and start afresh.
											 With the new and more stable site,we were able to implement that which the client wanted and also
											  use the understanding we had in coding whilst learning new and useful things such as how to link a site to a paid account and basically bring in our own creativity to the table.</p>
